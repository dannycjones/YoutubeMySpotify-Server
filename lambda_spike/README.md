Brain dump:
Bought domain in route53, somehow messed around with it until I could get some ssl certificate (TODO, come back to this).

Using serverless and serverless-domain-manager to deploy creates, for the given environemnt, the stack, lambda, api gateway api and does some domain config there aswell idk.
